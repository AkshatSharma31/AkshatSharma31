# 🩸 Digital Architect of Matter

> *"Synthesis is the hardware. Theory is the software. I build the bridge."*

### 📡 The Signal
I am an undergraduate researcher at **IISER Kolkata**, focused on the **algorithmic understanding of self-assembly**.
I combine the "dirty hands" of inorganic synthesis with the precise logic of computational chemistry to decode complex materials.
